# AI in Machine Assembling
### Predictive Maintenance using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains our research work **“AI in Machine Assembling”**, which focuses on applying Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques for predictive maintenance in industrial manufacturing systems. The project aims to predict machine failures in CNC milling operations using sensor and operational data, enabling proactive maintenance and reduced unplanned downtime.
